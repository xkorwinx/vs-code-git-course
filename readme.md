## Summary

---

I’m going to become a Front-End developer, because I consider this the most trendy way in development. This is both technical and, to some extent, creative work. I like the front-end because you can experiment, see the result immediately and get all sorts of beautiful things.

I am a persistent and diligent person. I love complex and unusual tasks and I like to achieve my goals and learn new things.

## Skills

---

**I had some experience with the following technologies and tools:**

* HTML5;
* css;
* JS;
* ES6;
* Git;
* GitHub;
* IDE (Visual Studio Code);

## Code example

---

**This is application methods get- and set- in objects in JS:**

```
<script>
    let temperature = {
        Celsius: 36.6,
        get Fahrenheit() {
            return 1.8 * this.Celsius + 32;
        },
        set Fahrenheit (newFahrenheit) {
            this.Celsius = (newFahrenheit - 32)/1.8;
        },
        get Kelvin() {
            return this.Celsius + 273;
        },
        set Kelvin (newKelvin) {
            this.Celsius = newKelvin - 273;
        },
    }
//   temperature.Fahrenheit = 80;
//
    temperature.Celsius = 420;
    console.log(temperature.Celsius);
    console.log(temperature.Fahrenheit);
    console.log(temperature.Kelvin);
</script>
```

* Layout of several landing pages;
* Studying information on the different sources like [learn.javascript.ru](https://learn.javascript.ru/);
* Self-training and working with JS operators, cycles, functions, arrays, objects, implementation of sorting algorithms, etc.
* Classes and training with friends who work as Front End Developers.
